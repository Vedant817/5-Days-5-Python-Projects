# 5 Days, 5 Python Projects

Welcome to the "5 Days, 5 Python Projects" repository! This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in Python programming by building five different projects over five days.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and project descriptions for the following Python projects:

1. Cricket Score Tracker
2. Data Analysis-Diabetes 
3. Face Recognition 
4. Movie Recommendation System
5. Object Detection

## Technologies Used

These projects utilize various technologies and libraries to accomplish their goals. Here are the key technologies used:

- **Python:** A high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility.

- **NLP:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language.

- **Computer Vision:** Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and systems that enable computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.
- **EDA:** EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. The primary purpose of EDA is to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and trends within the data before applying more complex statistical models or machine learning algorithms.
